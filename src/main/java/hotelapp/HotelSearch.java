package hotelapp;

/** The driver class for project 3 part 1.
 * The main function should take the following command line arguments:
 * -hotels hotelFile -reviews reviewsDirectory -threads numThreads -output filepath
 * (order may be different)
 * and read general information about the hotels from the hotelFile (a JSON file),
 * as well as concurrently read hotel reviews from the json files in reviewsDirectory.
 * The data should be loaded into data structures that allow efficient search.
 * If the -output flag is provided, hotel information (about all hotels and reviews)
 * should be output into the given file.
 * See pdf description of the project for the requirements.
 * You are expected to add other classes and methods from project 1 to this project,
 * and take instructor's / TA's feedback from a code review of project 1 into account.
 * Your program should still be able to support search functions like in project 1
 * (search does not need to be concurrent).
